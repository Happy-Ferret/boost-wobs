# Boost without Bullshit (boost-wo-bs)

Boost without Bullshit is exactly what it says. No configuration, no fat. Add it directly to your project, and don't waste time trying to build a library. 

Here's what's included:

### operators.hpp
* http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_57_0/libs/utility/operators.htm
* Exactly the same as what's documented, except boost iterators are not supported.
